<br/>"Electron Beam Additive Manufacturing"  <br/>
Electron Beam Additive Manufacturing (EBAM) is an emerging AM technology for metals. Among other energy sources like Arc, Laser, Ultrasonic energy, and friction energy, Electron Beam has several advantages such as high scanning speed, energy efficiency, versatile with several materials and better part integrity due to vacuum working environment. These advantages are the reasons for its scope for metal Additive Manufacturing. We are indigenously developing three systems for EBAM: 1. Powder-bed sintering (EBAM-P), 2.Wire-cladding (EBAM-W), 3. Laminating sheets (EBAM-S).
