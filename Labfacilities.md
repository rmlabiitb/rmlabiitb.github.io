<br/><br/><br/><br/>"4-axis HLM"  <br/>
<p align ="justify">4-axis Hybrid Layered Manufacturing (4-axis HLM) is synergic integration of deposition and subtraction processes. Cladding (MIG, TIG and Laser) processes are used for the deposition of the metals and face milling is used for subtraction process. This setup is used when simple planner without undercut and overhang features need to be achieved.</p>

{% include image.html url="/images/EBAM.PNG" width=440 align="right" %}
<br/>"Electron Beam Additive Manufacturing"  <br/>
<p align ="justify">Electron Beam Additive Manufacturing (EBAM) is an emerging AM technology for metals. Among other energy sources like Arc, Laser, Ultrasonic energy, and friction energy, Electron Beam has several advantages such as high scanning speed, energy efficiency, versatile with several materials and better part integrity due to vacuum working environment. These advantages are the reasons for its scope for metal Additive Manufacturing. We are indigenously developing three systems for EBAM: 1. Powder-bed sintering (EBAM-P), 2.Wire-cladding (EBAM-W), 3. Laminating sheets (EBAM-S). </p>
